Paragraph or list about the things you learned from this module: 
	Since this module mainly involved the creation of an application with a user interface for previous exercises, 
I learned the basics of RShiny. Shiny is an R package that can build interactive web applications in R. Since RShiny can 
be extended with CSS, I used that to style the app since I'm familiar with how to style using CSS. Shiny app structures 
mainly consist of 3 parts: server, ui, and the app. The app is where all packages are loaded, and runs the program. The server
contains the logic of the application, and the ui contains what the user sees on the application page and how its contents are 
laid out. My application has three dependencies: shiny, shinydashboard, and rhandsontable. Shiny is for making the app itself. 
Shinydashboard is mainly used for the ui of the application, and rhandsontable was used for the table inputs for Quadratic 
Spline Interpolation, DIVOC Shipping Analysis problem using Simplex Method, and the generic solver for maximization and 
minimization problems.
